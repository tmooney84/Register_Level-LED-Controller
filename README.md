## Installation

To run this repository locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository 
using HTTPS:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/tmooney84/Register_Level-LED-Controller.git
    ```

using SSH:
    ```sh
    git clone git@github.com:tmooney84/Register_Level-LED-Controller.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd /Register_Level-LED-Controller
    ```

## Usage

### 1. If running on a physical STM Nucleo-F411RE Board 

    A. open the STM32CubeIDE and connect the board using the microUSB cable. If you need to install STM32CubeIDE visit     https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html.
    
    B. Once you have opened the IDE, make sure you are in the correct workspace and navigate to the Register_Level-LED-Controller project and the proj_1_led_controller sub-directory. The main project code can be found in the Src and Inc sub-directories.

    C. Next build the project and download the firmware to the STM board. Look to IDE Help guide for further details.
    
    D. Once the firmware is loaded on the board, the on-board button at PC-13 should toggle the PA-5 LED on and off.

### 2. If emulating the the board using Renode, 
  A. Open Renode and start the Renode Script (.resc) for the virtual board and firmware.
  
  ```renode
  start @/absolute-path-to-repository-folder/renode-emulation/proj_1.resc
  ```

  B. To simulate Pressing and Releasing the button type Press and Release commands in succession and then check the virtual LED's state.
  
  ```renode
  (nucleo_f411re) gpioc.buttonPC13 Press
  ```
 
  ```renode
  (nucleo_f411re) gpioc.buttonPC13 Release
  ```
  
  ```renode
  (nucleo_f411re) gpioa.greenled2 State
  ```


## Future Improvements
  -Interrupt-based logic connecting the button and LED 
  
  -Include UART debugging and Robot Framework Testing
